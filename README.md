# Creating interactive modules for teaching with sports data


> This page provides information and resources for the <a
> href="https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots25/program/workshops/w13"
> target="_blank">USCOTS 2025 workshop</a> on creating statistics and
> data science teaching modules with sports data, hosted by the
> <a href="https://scorenetwork.org" target="_blank">SCORE Network</a>.

## About the Workshop

This 3-hour workshop introduces participants to the SCORE Network—an
NSF-funded initiative that supports sports-based statistics education.
Participants will explore examples, brainstorm their own module ideas,
and begin outlining a new module for submission. Modules submitted
within four weeks of USCOTS will receive an **expedited peer review**.

No strong sports knowledge required…but an interest in using real data
in the classroom is mandatory!
