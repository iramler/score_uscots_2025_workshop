# Creating Teaching Modules with the SCORE Network


> This page provides information and resources for the USCOTS 2025
> workshop on creating statistics and data science teaching modules with
> sports data, hosted by the [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org).

## About the Workshop

This 3-hour workshop introduces participants to the SCORE Network—an
NSF-funded initiative that supports sports-based statistics education.
Participants will explore examples, brainstorm their own module ideas,
and begin outlining a new module for submission. Modules submitted
within four weeks of USCOTS will receive an **expedited peer review**.

No strong sports knowledge required…but an interest in using real data
in the classroom is mandatory!
