> This page provides information and resources for the USCOTS 2025 workshop on creating statistics and data science teaching modules with sports data, hosted by the [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org).

## About the Workshop

This 3-hour workshop introduces participants to the SCORE Network—an NSF-funded initiative that supports sports-based statistics education. Participants will explore examples, brainstorm their own module ideas, and begin outlining a new module for submission. Modules submitted within four weeks of USCOTS will receive an **expedited peer review**.

No strong sports knowledge required...but an interest in using real data in the classroom is mandatory!
